# Unconstrained Optimization

## Summary

It is presented an optimization routine in MATLAB that performs unconstrained optimization. The routine optimizes quadratic and non-quadratics functions using the Steepest Descent and the BFGS quasi-Newton methods. Two functions were tested, a quadratic function and [Rosenbrockâ€™s function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function). The procedure and results are presented below.
