# Monte Carlo simulation to optimize Rastrigin function

## Summary

It is presented a Monte Carlo algorithm (simulated annealing) implementation in Matlab. The algorithm is used to optimize the [Rastrigin function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastrigin_function). After testing the program with three different starting points, The objective function ended below 0.5 (9 out of 10 times). The average number of function calls was 2335.
